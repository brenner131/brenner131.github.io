## The Dreary Coast: Imagining the Gowanus Canal

**Project description:** [The Dreary Coast](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/theater/the-dreary-coast-on-the-banks-of-the-gowanus-canal.html) was an immersive theater piece re-telling the Persephone myth in and around the Gowanus Canal.

Audience members could experience the show from a seat on a skiff piloted by Charon (the ferryman of Hades), or from vantage points on shore, depending on the type of ticket they had purchased.

We knew the experience of being up close and personal with the canal would make an impression on our audience, cast, and crew, and had an opportunity to capture their responses after the show via a survey and ticket sale records. 

### 1. Methodology

All cast, crew, and audience members' contact information were collected in a database. An online survey was circulated to all participants, and closed after two weeks. 158 responses out of a possible 460 were received, for a response rate of 34%

### 2. Results 

Responses to the survey generally followed the same trends:

Most people wanted the canal to be cleaner.

Most people could see themselves coming back to the area in the future.

Most people felt more connected to the Canal, but this differed by group. While the largest proportion of the Crew felt connected to the canal, the Boat and Shore audience differed significantly in their responses (Chi Sq = 15.7, p < .05), with the Boat audience reporting a stronger feeling of connection than the Shore audience. While the Crew had been involved in Canal projects for weeks if not years, the Boat experience lasted only a few hours. Yet, it involved closer proximity to the water, the actors, and for most participants a wholly new perspective of the Canal compared to the Shore audience; perhaps these elements contributed to their responses.

Mapping ticket sales also provides some insight into the audience. While we pursued many opportunities to connect with people in the immediate neighborhood, a substantial proportion of our audience came from Williamsburg and Lower Manhattan; audiences with a taste for advebnture and tolerance for strange experiences.

### 3. A Few Favorite Quotes
"I felt like I was let in on a secret, to see the city I'd lived in my whole life from a completely different view point - one that is both stagnated and fleeting. I felt that it provoked me to think more about my surrounds and regard this polluted waterway with more potential."

"It exposed me to the launching restaurant and bar, made me realize how easy it is to get to, and sparked my curiosity about getting to know area more."

"I am professionally involved in the clean up of New York City waters generally, and have done work specifically related to the Canal.  It was an extraordinary change of perspective to see very familiar sites inspiring a creative response, rather than an environmental or development response.  The transformation was magical."

### 4. Key Takeaways

The Dreary Coast was, first and foremost, a creative project that sought to bring artists to a wild space with opportunities for transformation. It was also an example of art make without institutional support. But this small dataset illustratoed to  the creators that their work showed an audience of newcomers and the established community what the Gowanus Canal is, and what it could become with their engagement.
