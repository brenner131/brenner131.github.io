## Visitor Research at the Brooklyn Museum

**Project description:** The Brooklyn Museum periodically studies how visitors are using its resources. Between December 2014 and April 2015, I assisted in an evaluation of the Brooklyn Museum's approach to labels to learn how visitors use the introductory panels, and what variables may affect how long visitors spend with the panels.

Introductory panels are the big text at the entrans of the exhibit, for example the black text about Egúngún as seen in this image:

### 1. Methodology

Each panel was observed for two hours on weekend days. The observer measured the level of engagement based on time spent viewing the panel, using the following scale:

Ignore – Visitor passes by but fails to engage
Orient – < 5 seconds; very cursory attention, checking out the resources and moving on quickly
Explore – 5-30 seconds; spending a short amount on inspection of resource/work
Discover – 30 seconds-1 minute; stopping, looking, taking it in
Immerse – > 1 minute; stopping longer, taking it in more deeply, considering – possibly bring work/resource to the attention of a companion and discussing it


### 2. Who Visits the Museum, and How Do They Use Introductory Panels?

The number of visitors observed at each exhibition ranged from 116 to 513 per two-hour observation period.

The vast majority of visitors in this sample were adults (2251, or 85% of this sample); about 7% were teens; and about 6% were children. No age was recorded for 57 individuals, less than 2% of the sample.

Most visitors were part of a group, ranging from the 701 groups of 2 people (50% of the total sample) to a single group of 11 people (less than 1% of the sample). 477 individuals, or 34% of the groups in the sample, were visiting solo.

In this chart, we can get a sense of how much the time spent viewing the panel varied for each exhibition, and between different exhibitions. Each dot represents an individual. Each exhibition is represented along the X axis, and amount of time spent viewing the introductory panel is represented by the Y axis – the higher up the dot, the longer the person viewed the panel. Where the dots are clustered indicates more visitors reading for the same amount of time.

For both the Permanent Collection and Special Exhibitions, a little more than half of the visitors ignored the panel. Visitors were more likely to show a brief, “Orient” response (less than 5 seconds) to the Permanent Collection panels than for the Special Exhibition panels, but were more likely to view the Special Exhibition panels for longer, landing in the “Discover” and “Immerse” categories (30 seconds or longer).

As we saw, most visitors were part of a group. Did groups show a different pattern of engagement than solo visitors? We compared the distribution of engagement for solo visitor and visitors in groups of two or more. 
Being a part of a group did seem to affect engagement: the distributions of engagement for groups were significantly different. Individuals in groups were more likely to ignore the panels than solo visitors, and less likely to take part in higher levels of engagement.

### 3. Key Takeaways

Slightly less than half the sample engaged with the introductory panels. 

Engagement varied quite widely between different exhibitions; visitors tended to engage more with Special Exhibition panels than with Permanent Collection panels. 

Most visitors were part of a group, but solo visitors were more likely to engage with the panels. 

### 4. How do we use this information?

This work was featured in the Spring 2016 issue of Exhibition, [Exploring the “Sticky-Note Effect”](https://www.name-aam.org/exhibition_spring2016), by Sara Devine, and contributed to the design and adoption of engagement initiatives like the "ASK" program.
